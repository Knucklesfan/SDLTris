<!--Welcome one and all to the modifier stuff-->
<!--Modifiers are basically just lua scripts (or hardcoded functions) that run every frame (or other situation) that gets triggered when needed-->
<!--There's a few triggers, but you can also just add value modifiers and those work too!-->
<!--This is a basic modifier that modifies values, but more complex ones will be in the game later on so...-->

        <description>Gives you a much faster level-up combo, but with a faster drain as well!
            Every rotate has a 1/20th chance to forcedrop!
