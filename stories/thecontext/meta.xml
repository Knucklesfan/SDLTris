    <scenes> <!--Stories are made up of scenes. Scenes can either be defined in their own xml and lua files, or be defined inline for simple scenes. The game comes built-in with baseline scenes and input mechanics for easy access of scenes. CD-I demos these scenes, but for futher context, please see The Context for a good example of every scene used to its max potential!-->
